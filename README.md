# 🚀 AI & Data Science Journey: Road to Semester 5

Welcome to my learning laboratory! This repository documents my 1.5-year journey to mastering Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, starting from my 2nd semester of Engineering.

## 🎯 The Goal
- **Target:** Data Science / ML Engineering Internship (Semester 5).
- **Current Phase:** Python Foundations & Data Handling.
- **Methodology:** The "Sandwich Routine" (1hr Theory in AM, 1.5hr Coding in PM).
