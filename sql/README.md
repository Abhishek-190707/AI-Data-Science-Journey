# SQL Learning Journey

This folder documents my structured SQL practice — from fundamentals to advanced querying and optimization.

The goal is not just syntax familiarity, but strong logical thinking, relational design, and query performance awareness.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Master core SQL concepts (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, HAVING)
- Design relational schemas with proper constraints
- Write complex multi-table queries
- Understand indexing and performance optimization
- Build real-world mini projects

---

## 📅 Structure

Each day is organized into separate files

---

## 🧱 Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- Aliasing (AS)

### Relational Design
- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
- Table relationships (1-to-many, many-to-many)

### Intermediate
- JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- CTEs (WITH)
- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### Advanced
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Indexing concepts
- Query optimization basics
- Execution plans

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- DBeaver / MySQL Workbench
- LeetCode / HackerRank SQL problems

---

## 🎯 Practice Approach

For each session:
- Design or extend schema
- Insert structured test data
- Solve multiple query problems
- Document key learnings in comments

The focus is on understanding *why* a query works, not just getting the correct output.

---

## 📈 Progress Philosophy

Consistency > Intensity

The aim is daily practice with increasing complexity, moving from syntax recall to query fluency and performance awareness.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Build a complete mini project (e.g., e-commerce or student management system)
- Optimize queries using indexing and EXPLAIN
- Solve 200+ real interview-style SQL problems
