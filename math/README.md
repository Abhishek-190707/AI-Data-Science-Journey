# Mathematics for Machine Learning

This folder contains my daily mathematics practice and implementations for building strong foundations in Machine Learning.

The goal is to understand the intuition behind concepts, not just formulas, and apply them through small coding exercises and mini projects.

## Topics Covered
- Linear Algebra (Vectors, Matrices, PCA intuition)
- Probability & Statistics (Bayes theorem, Distributions, Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing)
- Calculus for ML (Derivatives, Gradients, Gradient Descent)

## Structure
Each file follows a daily learning format:

day-XX-topic-name.ipynb

Example:
- day-31-vectors-cosine-similarity.ipynb
- day-32-matrices-multiplication.ipynb

## Approach
For every topic:
1. Theory study
2. Concept intuition
3. Implementation from scratch
4. NumPy verification
5. Mini project
6. GitHub commit

## Outcome
This phase builds the mathematical intuition required to:
- understand ML algorithms
- debug models
- interpret optimization
- avoid “black-box” learning
