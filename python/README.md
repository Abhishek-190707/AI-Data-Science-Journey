# Python & Data Analysis Foundations

This folder contains my Python fundamentals and data analysis practice.

The focus is on writing clean, efficient code and mastering the core tools used daily by Data Scientists.

## Topics Covered
- Python Basics (loops, functions, file handling)
- NumPy fundamentals
- pandas for data manipulation
- Data cleaning
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Mini analysis projects

## Structure
Files are organized day-wise:

day-XX-topic-name.ipynb

Example:
- day-01-python-basics.ipynb
- day-10-pandas-cleaning.ipynb
- day-20-eda-visualization.ipynb

## Approach
Each notebook includes:
- concept explanation
- code implementation
- examples
- small exercises
- practical mini projects

## Outcome
This section develops the practical skills required for:
- real-world data cleaning
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- feature preparation
