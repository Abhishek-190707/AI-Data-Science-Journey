# 🚀 AI & Data Science Journey: Road to Semester 5

Welcome to my learning laboratory! This repository documents my 1.5-year journey to mastering Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, starting from my 2nd semester of Engineering.

## 🎯 The Goal
- **Target:** Data Science / ML Engineering Internship (Semester 5).
- **Current Phase:** Python Foundations & Data Handling.
- **Methodology:** The "Sandwich Routine" (1hr Theory in AM, 1.5hr Coding in PM).

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `Phase-1-Python-Foundations/`: Basics, Loops, Logic, and Data Structures.
- `Phase-2-Math-for-ML/`: Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics.
- `Phase-3-Machine-Learning/`: Scikit-Learn projects and Kaggle competitions.
- `Portfolio-Projects/`: End-to-end applications (Predictors, Analyzers, etc.).
